# MY PROCESS

After launching the instance, we are provided with a file named ```local-target``` and its source file in C.

After viewing the source code, I noticed this:

We have to make sure that we can assign ```num``` to 65 in order to get the flag.

## SOLVING

I made a payload that can overflow the ```input``` since it's only 16 bytes long and ends with A since ```0xA``` in ASCII is 65.

The payload - ```352124658264526476846262A``` <- can be any numbers as long as its 24 letters long and ends with A

After that, the flag for the challenge will be shown.
