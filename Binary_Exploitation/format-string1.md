# MY PROCESS

Same with format-string 0, we are provided with binary and C file.

After going through those, I connected to the provided connection.

## SOLVING

Once you have connected to the provided connection, this will show up:

For this one, I created a payload consisting of:
- ```%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p```

Once entered, this will show up:

Then I went to ```CyberChef``` and used ```From Hex``` function, and this will show up:

From there, we can see that ```{FTCocip5_14m1n44x4_31y71e_g41f_}8108e1``` might be the flag, but it is jumbled.

So I removed everything until only ```{FTCocip5_14m1n44x4_31y71e_g41f_}8108e1``` will show up in the output.

From here on out, it is just arranging those hex in a ```LIFO``` manner.

From there, you can see in the output that everything is just reversed.

After you un-reverse(is this a word? lol) it, that is the flag for that challenge.
