# MY PROCESS

We are given a binary file and a C file. We can tinker around with the binary file but it won't give us the answer. The C file is for you to understand what it will do once you connect to the given connection.

In the main function, we can see that we have to create a ```flag.txt``` file.

Noticing the ```serve_patrick``` function that we need to enter from one of the 3 choices that can break the format.

Same thing with the ```serve_bob``` function too. But once you entered the correct choice, the flag will be revealed to you.

## SOLVING

**MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE GIVEN CONNECTION!**

For the first choice, I chose ```Gr%114d_Cheese``` and this will show up:

Now for the second choice, I chose ```Cla%sic_Che%s%steak```.

And once you entered that, the flag for that challenge will show.
