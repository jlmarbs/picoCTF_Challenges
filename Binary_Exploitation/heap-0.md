# MY PROCESS

We are given a binary file and a source C file.

Basing from the source code, we have to overflow the safe_var.

## SOLUTION

After connecting to the provided server, we are given this options:

Now what I did is to check the safe_var which is ```bico```. I will have to overwrite that to have a segmentation fault.

Now what I did is go for ```Option 2``` and input the following:

And then after choosing ```Option 1``` this will show up:

We have successfully overwritten ```bico``` from the safe_var.

Print the flag and it will show the flag for the challenge.
