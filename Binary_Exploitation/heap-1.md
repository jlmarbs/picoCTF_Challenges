# MY PROCESS

Same with heap 0, we are given a binary and a source code files.

But this time when I look into the source code,

We have to make the safe_var to ```pico``` in order to get the flag.

## SOLVING

After I connected to the provided server, I am greeted with this:

As we can see that the safe_var for now is ```bico``` and we have to change it to ```pico```.

What I did is that I enter the 2nd option and try to overflow and end it with ```pico```.

But after printing the heap, I noticed something:

There is a certain number of how many letters will be inputted to the safe_var.

I counted and it stores up until ```32```.

So what I did is that I randomly input 32 characters and then end with ```pico```.

After printing the heap, the safe_var is now finally ```pico```.

Print the flag and then the flag for the challenge will be revealed.
