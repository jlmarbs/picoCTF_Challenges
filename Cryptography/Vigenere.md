And then after reading on the hint, we need to use ```Vigenere Cipher``` to get the flag for this challenge.

## SOLVING

What I did is that, I searched for a website that can decode Vigenere.
- Website Used: ```https://www.cs.du.edu/~snarayan/crypt/vigenere.html```

After inputting the encrypted text and the key provided in the challenge, the output is the flag for the challenge.
