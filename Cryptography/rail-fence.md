# MY PROCESS

We are given a ```message.txt``` file and then a link to a ```Rail Fence Cipher```.

Once reading and understanding what rail fence cipher is, it is time to decode the flag that is inside of ```message.txt```.

## SOLVING

As much as I love to try this in paper, I went to a website instead.
- Website used: ```https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/rail-fence-cipher```

After inputting the text and setting the correct offset, the output will be the flag of the challenge.
