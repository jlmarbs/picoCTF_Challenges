# MY PROCESS

We are given a filed named ```encrypted.txt```
Upon reading the text file, it will show us this:

This is seem like a Caesar Cipher encryption.

## SOLVING

I went to ```CyberChef``` after I copied the content in ```encrypted.txt```.

I used ROT13 and tinkered with the Amount section.
- Alternative is you can use ROT13 Bruteforce and check the output for the flag.

The flag for the challenge will be revealed once you have the correct amount.
