# MY PROCESS

We are provided with a ```message.txt``` that looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aded967-fa33-47c7-82e2-1f09b806bcf0)

This got me thinking that we should solve this using ```Caesar Cipher```.

But, Looking at the first part of the message which is
- ```ZGSOCXPQUYHMILERVTBWNAFJDK```

This got me thinking that it is still ```Caesar Cipher``` but we need to have a key which is that.

## SOLVING

I went to a website called ```https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/keyed-caesar-cipher```.

I pasted the contents of ```message.txt``` in it and pasted the key in the key box.

After pressing decode, the flag for the challenge is there.
