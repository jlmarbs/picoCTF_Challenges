# MY PROCESS

We are provided with a ```message.txt``` file and this is what it looks like:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/887ad8fe-5d8e-45c5-b1c3-ca3c64c9fde2)

And based from the given description, it got scrambled every blocks of 3.

## SOLVING

What I did is that I pasted the message on a text editor and split them into blocks of 3:

And then, every blocks of 3, I rearranged them in a ```312``` manner since it made sense like this:

After you transpose them, the final output will be the flag for the challenge.

### NOTE
Arranging in a ```312``` manner basically means that, the 3rd variable will be placed first, the 1st will be placed second and the 2nd will be on the last.

- Example:
  - anj - jan
