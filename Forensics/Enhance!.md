# MY PROCESS

We are provided with a .SVG image file. Since I do not know how to extract information on an .svg image, I tried opening the page source of the image.

## SOLVING

After opening the image using ```View page source```, this is what it looks like
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/603ec7c3-bf78-400d-b838-b736638554d3)

After scrolling down in ```<g></g>```, I noticed the flag is there, but it is sectioned so I had to type it on a text editor.

And that is the flag for that challenge.
