# MY PROCESS

We are provided with ```anthem.flag.txt``` file which contains a very long message, and the flag is within in the texts.

## SOLVING

Since we need to find the flag within the text, we will use ```grep``` to find it.

I just did ```cat anthem.flag.txt | grep "pico"```

After doing that, the flag for that challenge is there.
