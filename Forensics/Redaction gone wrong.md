# MY PROCESS

We are provided with a PDF file and looks like this when opened:

## SOLVING

What I actually do here is that I checked first if the redacted messages can be copied by hovering through them to see if the cursor changed.

The first two did not contain the flag.

After copying what's inside of the 3rd redacted text, you will get the flag for that challenge.
