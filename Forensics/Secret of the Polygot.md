# MY PROCESS

We are provided with a PDF file when opened, it looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beaf4261-7c3b-4847-80f7-5599f775cde1)

It looked like half of the flag was given to us, and we're tasked to find the other half and complete it.

## SOLVING
I ```exiftool``` the given PDF file and it showed that it is also a PNG file.

So I renamed the file by doing ```cp flag2of2-final.pdf flagoutput.png```
Opening the PNG file will look like this:

It looked like the first half of the flag.
After combining those two in a text editor, you will get the complete flag of that challenge.
