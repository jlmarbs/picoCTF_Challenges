# MY PROCESS

Upon extracting the provided zip file, we are tasked to find the file name named ```uber-secret.txt```

## SOLVING:
I did ```find files``` and it revealed the file path for ```uber-secret.txt```

Right after that, I just copied the file path and then did:
- ```cat files/adequate_books/more_books/.secret/deeper_secrets/deepest_secrets/uber-secret.txt```

Upon doing that, the flag will be revealed.

## REALIZATION
Funny thing was, you can actually see the file path after you extract the file.

Then you'll just do the cat command!
