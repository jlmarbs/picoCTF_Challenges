# MY PROCESS

When looking at the hints, I noticed that we need to use **git**.
But what type of git command?
In hint 3, it gives us that when commiting a file with git, a message can be included.
So that got me thinking we should use **git log**.

## SOLVING:
- I unzipped the given zip file. It gives us a file directory afterwards.

- when going to the drop-in directory, there is a message.txt file.
- reading the message will result to this

- i used the git log command on the message.txt file. ```git log message.txt```

Once doing that, the flag will be provided on the commit message.
