## SOLVING

Actually, this is just basic binary operations LOL.
- Websites if you don't know how to do this yet
  - ```www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-hex.html```
  - ```www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/bit-shift```
  - ```www.calculator.net/binary-calculator.html```
  - NOTE: ```AND OPERATOR = 1 & 1 = 1, 1 & 0 = 0, 0 & 1 = 0, 0 & 0 = 0```
  - NOTE: ```OR OPERATOR = 1 & 1 = 1, 1 & 0 = 1, 0 & 1 = 1, 0 & 0 = 0```

After converting the last operator into a hexadecimal, you will be given the flag for the challenge.
