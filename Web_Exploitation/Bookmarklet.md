# MY PROCESS

After launching the instance, we are given a website link which looks like this:

And then after you press in the box, it will copy what's inside of it:

So we have to find a way to make that JS function run.

## SOLVING

Then after pressing enter, there will be an alert pop up showing you the flag of the challenge.
