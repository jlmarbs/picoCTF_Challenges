# MY PROCESS

After launching the instance, we are provided with a website and it looks like this:

But basing on the hint, we have to successfully log in to the website in order to get the flag.

## SOLVING

I tried ```user: admin pass: admin```, but it shows Log In Failed.

So I tried viewing the page source the website to see if I can get anything to get the correct credentials.

Aside from the script in the website, there was one directory that I was curious to see which was ```secure.js```.

So I added ```/secure.js``` to the URL and this is the result:

Now we got the correct credentials to log in and get the flag.

After logging in, you will be greeted with a flag for the challenge.
