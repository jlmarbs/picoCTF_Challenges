# MY PROCESS

After launching the instance we are provided with a website.

My thought process with this one is I'll look first on the page source if I can get anything.

## SOLVING

After opening the page source, I was greeted with this:

Everything in one line LOL.

So I just scrolled through the page source, and the flag is actually there.

## REALIZATION

There is a line wrap that can actually make finding the flag easier...
