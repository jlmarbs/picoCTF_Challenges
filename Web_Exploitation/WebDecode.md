# MY PROCESS

After launching the instance, we are provided with a web server and a task to search for the flag using inspector.

## SOLVING

After I went to the website, I started using ```Inspect Element``` on the home page, but nothing was interesting there.

Then I went to the ```About``` page, and saw something interesting.

It looked like a base64 string. So I copied that and decode it using:
- ```echo <base64string> | base64 -d```

The output will be the flag for the challenge.
